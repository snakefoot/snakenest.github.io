SnakeTail ver. 1.8.1 is now available, and introduces some new features:

- Configure external tools and bind custom shortcut key
- Toggle bookmarks and quickly jump between bookmarks

Also discovered my idea to use a dummy google-account to upload crash dump, no longer works.
Google SMTP server now finds it suspicious that the account performs logins from random locations.
I have now changed the send crash report logic to use Crash-Server.com
