SnakeTail now supports drag drop from Windows Explorer to tail new files.
Default configuration for new files can be made by saving a session file with one configured window as ‘SnakeTail.xml’.

It will look for the default session file in the following locations:

- Application Path/SnakeTail.xml
- Current User AppData/Roaming/SnakeTail/SnakeTail.xml
- Current User AppData/Local/SnakeTail/SnakeTail.xml
- Common AppData/SnakeTail/SnakeTail.xml
