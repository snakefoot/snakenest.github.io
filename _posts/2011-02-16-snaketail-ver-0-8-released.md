SnakeTail is yet another tail application, which tries to provide the following important features:

- MDI windows, so one can monitor multiple tail files without switching between tabs.
- Display and search the entire log file and not just the last 64 KByte.
- High performance and low memory footprint.
- Monitor the Windows Event Log.
- Works on all modern Windows versions without needing administrator rights.

These features were hard to find in the [available utilities](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/113121/) found on the Internet.

As an added side bonus then it gave me some experience in developing on the .NET platform.
